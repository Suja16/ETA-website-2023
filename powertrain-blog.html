        <div class="text-justify mt-4 mb-5">To reduce CO2 emissions, it is necessary to increase the fuel economy. This implies extracting the kinetic energy from the combustion energy with
minimum losses.<br>
Using a leaner air-fuel ratio is recommended, this will result in the reduction of
unburnt fuel left behind.<br>
Increasing Compression ratio, increasing compression ratio increases the
efficiency of the combustion process. If the mixture is more compressed, the
temperatures will be higher, even before the spark and the combustion will be
more complete, decreasing CO emissions.<br>
Proper engine tuning is also an important step. The Engine relies on a lot of
different systems to operate, including fuel injection, timing, transmission, and
other important functions. Engine tuning allows you to fine-tune those
processes to get a much cleaner burn.<br>
Downsizing of transmission, by reducing the weight of the transmission,
reduces the load on the engine thereby reducing unburnt hydrocarbon
emissions.<br>
Friction losses can be reduced by replacing the sliding components with
bearings where ever possible.<br>
By using biofuels (Ethanol) instead of fossil fuels, Ethanol and other biofuels
are often touted for their ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by
replacing fossil fuels. Traditional biofuels like ethanol can reduce greenhouse
gas emissions by 19-48 percent compared with gasoline, while advanced or
cellulosic biofuels can reduce emissions by more than 100 percent.</div>
